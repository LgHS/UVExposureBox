# UVPlatesetter
Code and doc about UV Platesetter V2

# DevEnv
I develop with Visual Studio Community 2017 (free) and the extension Visual Micro that give a nice debugging experience. (shareware, 90 days trial, https://www.visualmicro.com/)
You can use the classical Arduino IDE to compile the code too.

Diagrams are made with KiCad (free and open source, http://kicad-pcb.org/download/)

# External Library
I use the following libraries:
 - Wire
 - Keypad and Keypad MC17
 - LiquidCrystal
