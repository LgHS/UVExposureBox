# UVPlatesetter
Code and doc about UV Platesetter V2

# DevEnv
I develop with Visual Studio Community 2017 (free) and the extension Visual Micro that give a nice debugging experience. (https://www.visualmicro.com/)
You can use the classical Arduino IDE to compile the code too.

#External Library
I use the following libraries:
 - Wire
 - Keypad and Keypad MC17
 - LiquidCrystal
